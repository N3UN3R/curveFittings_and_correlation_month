# curveFittings_and_correlation_month
This repository contains curve fitting implementation and correlation analysis of data

The analysis of each implemented algorithm is in its folder. Each folder contains
the following programs to analyze the data.


input_editor.py
-	Programm that contains functions the prepare the input data.
  creates the csv-files producer_to_runtimes.csv and producer_to_price.csv


korrelation_producer_runtime.py
- Program that calculates the correlation of the number of
  producer households and the reached running times and plots
  the data using matplotlib


producer_price.py
- Program that calculates a curve fitting for the number of producer
  households and the reached average prices and plots the data using
  matplotlib


producer_usedReductions.py
-	Program that contains functions to prepare the data of a month for plotting
  the used reductions for different number of producer households


plot_producer_reductions.py
- Program that plots the used reductions and the number of producer households

einsparung2019.py
-	Program that calculates the amount of money that could have been saved
  when using the network simplex algorithm for peer-to-peer trading in 2019

einsparung2020.py
-	Program that calculates the amount of money that could have been saved
  when using the network simplex algorithm for peer-to-peer trading in 2020
